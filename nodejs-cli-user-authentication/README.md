# Azure Active Directory authentication for CLI apps

Source code for article: https://labs.pineview.io/azure-active-directory-authentication-for-cli-apps/

We will guide you through the process of creating a CLI application with Node.js that elegantly and securely authenticates users with their Azure Active Directory (AD) credentials, using the OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange). 

This approach allows your application to operate in the context of the user, leveraging RBAC and the principle of least privilege to minimize security risks and streamline access management.
